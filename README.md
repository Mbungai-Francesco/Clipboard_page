## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I had to study flexbox for to help me complete the project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.uls ul:nth-child(2){
  text-align: center;
  width: 70%;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  margin: auto;
  padding-top: 2vh;
}
```

### Continued development

- Flexbox
- @media
- Responsiveness
